Hello reader, You are here! You are by far the minority because of that.

This of course is my first blog post on my Git Hub blog. I decided to set up this blog because sometimes I want to blog but I want to also dev log,  
so this is the best of both worlds. I had been keeping a dev log on one of my repos but this will be a dedicated dev log so that I can just keep all  
development details in one place.

I had been working through some boot camp courses recently and haven't had a lot of time to code, but I finished up the IBM Node/Express course and  
the IBM Python for AI and DataScience Course 2 days ago, so yesterday I had off and hit up SnakeEatsBoids code!!! I was able to finally implement  
the 3rd behavior between boid boid interation and it looks good. I built my behaviors differently than the norm, simply because I wanted the boids  
to have a little more 'sight' information. They perform well but different than other boid implementations which is great!.

I also had to help a friend with the brakes on his truck. He literally had a brakeline fail. When he pumped the brakes brake fluid sprayed all over  
the wheel well. That was fixed, now I think that I have air in my brake lines. My brake pedal doesn't immediately retract when I depress the brake.  
So I'll fill the resevoire and bleed the lines this saturday. I don't drive that car much anyways.

I recently have become an organizer for the Seattle Code and Coffee group that is meeting between every 2-4 weeks in downtown Seattle. It's great,  
and I'm hoping to find a job soon.

It's been 15 months since I've had any sort of income. The reason I'm trasitioning carreers is to save for retirement, not spend what little retirement  
I have. grumble grumble. I hope I dont end up taking a job a Taco Bell as the drive thru attendant. That would be 'salt in the wound'. All I can do is  
hope to get a well paying job. But I'm pretty sure my lack of a CS degree coupled with my mis aligned career in manufacturing combined with my age is just  
the perfect ingredients to have my resume trashed at every turn by even the most sympathetic recruiter. The worst part is, I'm getting a response of less  
that 1%. For every 100 (w/ customized resume/cover letter)applcations I submit I'll get roughly 1 online screening. After more than 1000 applications I've  
had 1 interview. At this rate I'll be dead by old age before I get a job. This is not encouraging at all.

I think I'm done blogging for today.

This is Travis signing off. Thanks for reading my Ligma Blog!
