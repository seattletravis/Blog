## Title: Mason Bees and Spring

I just finished the Django course for the IBM Full Stack Developer Program! Just now. That was fun. Now that I have some knowledge of Node, Flask, Django, JSON and SQL I feel like all the frameworks sort of have similar work flows, Some sort of Markup language like HTML, XML, or JSX, some sort of router like React-rounter, urls.py, or Flask equivalent, and they all have a place to put your logic for controlling everything and sending your CRUD requests. Ih ya and don't forget the DB's. So I'm picking it up, The hard part will be chosoing between Node, Flask, or Django for my full stack developer portfolio project.

Spring is the time of year to look forward to cherries and other yard plant experiments. I removed the grape vine. It made terrific raisins but the Phyloxera what a deal breaker. What a nasty little pest that is. I removed the lemon trees. It was a failed experiment. However I just installed the homes for the mason bees. This will be the first year that I keep bees. They have a fascinating live cycle. I decided to put them in this year because Terry is also starting to raise mason bees and is giving me some larva to start a colony. Mason bees should be just what I need to polinate the cherries.

I have parts for the car coming and need to replace the brake pads and rotors for all 4 wheels as well as bleed the brake lines. That will be a job. I'll do the brake job on Friday this week.

Brake Parts: Front Rotors, Rear Rotors, Front Pads, Rear Pads, Floor Jack, Jack Stands, Chock Blocks, Bleader Kit, C-Clamp, DOT-3 Brake Fluid, Silicon Lubricant Grease, Brake Lubricant Grease, Brake Cleaner Spray, 10mm box wrench, Impact Wrench, clips, Read Guide Pins, Front Guide Pins, vinyl gloves, and paper towels.

I really don't know why I listed the parts I'll be using to change the brakes, I just felt like it. There's a couple of sockets I didn't mention I think there's a 17mm and a breaker bar too. Anyways. Enough about that.

This last week I spend a couple of days getting the yard ready for the Mason Bees. They need an assortment of diffenent materials to be successful. They need a shelter that is protected from the rain and that also receives direct sun in the morning. They need wood or paper straws that they use to lay their eggs and shelter in over winter. They also need water and clay nearby. The requirements that I've read is that the bee housing should be about 5 feet off the ground and the clay water supply should be within 3 feet of the nest. They also have a smaller territory than Honey Bees. Mason Bees only travel around 300 feet from their nest while Honey bees typically have a teriitory of several square miles. So placing the Mason Bees close to the trees that need polinated is important.

With this in mind I placed 2 Mason Shelters out, one in the back yard near the
