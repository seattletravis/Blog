## Title: Mason Bees and Spring

I just finished the Django course for the IBM Full Stack Developer Program! Just now. That was fun. Now that I have some knowledge of Node, Flask, Django, JSON and SQL I feel like all the frameworks sort of have similar work flows, Some sort of Markup language like HTML, XML, or JSX, some sort of router like React-rounter, urls.py, or Flask equivalent, and they all have a place to put your logic for controlling everything and sending your CRUD requests. Ih ya and don't forget the DB's. So I'm picking it up, The hard part will be chosoing between Node, Flask, or Django for my full stack developer portfolio project.

Spring is the time of year to look forward to cherries and other yard plant experiments. I removed the grape vine. It made terrific raisins but the Phyloxera what a deal breaker. What a nasty little pest that is. I removed the lemon trees. It was a failed experiment. However I just installed the homes for the mason bees. This will be the first year that I keep bees. They have a fascinating live cycle. I decided to put them in this year because Terry is also starting to raise mason bees and is giving me some larva to start a colony. Mason bees should be just what I need to polinate the cherries.

I have parts for the car coming and need to replace the brake pads and rotors for all 4 wheels as well as bleed the brake lines. That will be a job. I'll do the brake job on Friday this week.
