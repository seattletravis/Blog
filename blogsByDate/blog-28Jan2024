Hello reader, You are here! You are by far the minority because of that.

This of course is my first blog post on my Git Hub blog. I decided to set up this blog because sometimes I want to blog but I want to also dev log, so this is the best of both worlds. I had been keeping a dev lop on one of my repos but this will be a dedicated dev log so that I can just keep all development details in one place.
