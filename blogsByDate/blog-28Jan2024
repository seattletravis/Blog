Hello reader, You are here! You are by far the minority because of that.

This of course is my first blog post on my Git Hub blog. I decided to set up this blog because sometimes I want to blog but I want to also dev log, so this is the best of both worlds. I had been keeping a dev log on one of my repos but this will be a dedicated dev log so that I can just keep all development details in one place.

I had been working through some boot camp courses recently and haven't had a lot of time to code, but I finished up the IBM Node course and the IBM Python for AI and DataScience Course 2 days ago so yesterday I had off and hit up SnakeEatsBoids!!! I was able to finally implement the 3 behavior between boid boid interation and it looks good. I built my behaviors differently than the norm, simply because I wanted the boids to have a little more 'sight' information. They perform well but different than other boid implementations which is great!.
