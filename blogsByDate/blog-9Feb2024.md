## Title: More Meetups!!!

Yesterday I attended another meetup for the first time. The meetup is the "Puget Sound Programming Python (PuPPy) meetup. The group is so larget that it breaks up into local meetup and the one closest to me is at the Beacon Hill Library with happens every Thursday at 5:30. There is no end time specified, but I called it at 7:30 and left. I think most of the other attendees left soon after I did. There was 14-15 people who attended, lets see if I can remember their names, Sage, Paul and Adrian are the hosts, and Kimberly and Jessica we're the girls that showed up. Then there was Andrew, and Erwin. As for the rest I don't remember. hmmm. I'll try better next time. Most of the conversations centered around finding jobs, defeating Applicant Tracking Systems, and Networking for jobs. Some poeple who were employed talked about what they do. There was a little talk about side projects but not much. Kimberly was getting reacquainted with git and GitHub so I helped her install git and showed her how to add files to a root directory in a repository. It was tough since I don't normally add files using the GitHub website. I normally use a bash CLI terminal either in editor or in a terminal. But it's nice going over that sort of stuff because now I just know how to do it with out thinking about it next time.

I really do like to see what projects everyone is working on. There was more backend project dealing with the system and AI with this group. This might be because Python inheriently is less of a front end languange. It does have a lot of frontend libraries, but JavaScript is far better for putting graphics up on the screen.
