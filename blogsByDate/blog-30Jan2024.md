## Title: Development and unemployment

Today I woke up and went to work on my SnakeBoidsAI game. I know that I have a bunch of other software to build and things to work on but there was some loose ends that really needed to be tied up. The worst part is, I really need a job. Every time I look at the job boards I just see all the hundreds of rejected applications for the same type of jobs. It's really deflating. So even if I build software my resume will still get me rejected. How do I know this, because I don't have the credentials that employers and recruiters are looking for/at in a resume. I might as well be a leper. I'm close to finishing up the Full Stack Developer Certification but again it's just not something that I feel anyone even cares about. How is it that I can't even get a job as IT Support? So I went to work on the Snake Game. I did get some stuff done that makes it way better. I wrote the logic for controlling the different power ups so now the game has some sort of method for applying powerups during game play, before I just had the game start with the speed power up enabled and had a big power pellet on the screen that if you ate you'd also become big as well as speed, both of which expired after 15 seconds.

I'll be raining here in Seattle today, so I'll spend the rest of the morning working on the IBM Certification. I really have no idea what to do to get a job. I wish I had a mentor, but I don't think anyone even likes me now a days. So It'll just me watching youtube videos trying to figure out what I should do next. Maybe I should just give up and get a job as a clerk at taco bell. At this point it's really an option.

signing off.
