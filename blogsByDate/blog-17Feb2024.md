## Title: Seattle Code and Coffee!

I've been blogging a lot lately and coding not so much, however I have a clear path to how to implement a win - endgame even in SnakeEatsBoids. Having a clear idea of what and how to implement a feature is way better than going in blind. So I'll be able to knock that out next time I have the project open.

I've been stuck in Course work with the IBM Full Stack Developer Program on Coursera. This is a time consuming class. But so far I have been learning a lot about CRUD operations and routing, which will be invaluable when I go to build a Full Stack Web App.

I'd like to build out a full stack project now, but I know that if I focus on the fundamentals on the front end I'll be able to save time building later on. So far I've taken a class on Node, SQL, Flask, and Django. Each new backend technology that I study brings with it some of the concepts of the previous classes. Flask and Node share a lot of the same requests, although implemented differently, SQL is basically a server instance of a cloud based DB, Django is Flask but with Admin and Authentication build in. It also has a directory system that is as critical to know as knowing Python itself. basically all these technologies are a remake of each other with different feature focus.
