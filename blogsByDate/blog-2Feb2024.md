## Title: Software Project that Didn't land a job! - Tilt3D

I've been hashing over my journey to find a software job over the past 2 years, and I'm wondering what it is about 'me' that isn't 'hireable'?

I want to do several more blogs on this topic, and that is Software Projects that didn't land a job. There's a lot of prep to do in order to land a job in tech. From leaning the the basics of programming (what language to use and why, JSON, packaging, IDE's, package managers), technologies that are universal to software production enviromnets like (Github, docker, kubernetes) and even how to interact with other programmers (scrum master, teams, CD/CI, UX/UI, mood boards). The list of stuff you need to know and know well goes on and on. But it's not only necessary to know all these things, you also have to show that you know them. So If you don't have a degree in CS (like me) and you don't have 5 years of experince (like me) then the best way to show off is with project. And I'm not saying that projects are bad. I really like them. Its a way to flex the brain muscles, and to create something that didn't exist before. So in the early days of my coding journey I started developing some software projects that not only would show off my skills as a computer programmer would magically get me a job that I so desperately need. The very first project is Tilt3D written in JavaScript. Good old vanila JS.
