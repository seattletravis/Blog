## Title: Coding and All Other Life Stuff.

My car has had some brake issues lately, the brakes stay slightly engagned when I lift my foot off the pedal. This is bad for the brakes, and also for gas milage, and also not safe. This is one of those things where I can save a lot of $$ by doing the job myself. Especially in Seattle where auto shops charge an arm and a leg. So I took my car over to a friends house who has a floor jack, impact wrench, and jack stands, all of which I used to get my car in the air and bleed the brakes. After all that the issue is not resolved, so I need to go over the brakes, replace the rotors, pads, grease the guide pins and contacts, and check out the calipers while I'm at it. This is one of those days where I really didn't even get to a computer until after 5pm, and even then, I'm not really in the mind frame to work on course work or build any code, but I do have the energy to talk about auto work...

It's one of the draw backs of trying to get a job as a developer. I have no income so I can't afford to take my car to a mechanic, and I don't have a lot of time either because I have a full work load, for building projects, course work, web design and website updates, and keeping up with meetups. Since I wasn't able to get the brakes working with just bleeding the lines, I'll have to wait for the parts to arrive then get the car in the air this next weekend. Most of the parts will be here Thursday of this week, so it might have to wait until sunday. I do have a second car but it's become a project. There's no tabs, the battery is disconnected, and there no insurance. My second car should really just be sold outright. It's hard to justify owning a project car and the seattle moisture isn't doing it any favors. It's pretty damp inside the car this time of year.
