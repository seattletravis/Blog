## Title: Coding and All Other Stuff.

My car has had some brake issues lately, the brakes stay slightly engagned when I lift my foot off the pedal. This is bad for the brakes, and also for gas milage, and also not safe. This is one of those things where I can save a lot of $$ by doing the job myself. Especially in Seattle where auto shops charge an arm and a leg. So I took my car over to a friends house who has a floor jack, impact wrench, and jack stands, all of which I used to get my car in the air and bleed the brakes. After all that the issue is not resolved, so I need to go over the brakes, replace the rotors, pads, grease the guide pins and contacts, and check out the calipers while I'm at it. This is one of those days where I really didn't even get to a computer until after 5pm, and even then, I'm not really in the mind frame to work on course work or build any code, but I do have the energy to talk about auto work...
