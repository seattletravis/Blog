## Title: Les Schwab... Fail!

My les schwab fail story.

My brakes started getting spongy, by that I mean that the brakes would stay engaged slightly when taking my foot off the pedal. This is obviously air o the line, so it's necessary to bleed the brakes.

So I read the documentation on my car on how to bleed the brakes and in order to do it I needed to get the whole car lifted and placed on jack stands. There's ways to bleed the brakes with out taking the wheels off but it's just easier for me to see what I'm doing with the wheels off, so each time I go to work on my car I'm going to be going through the extra work of lifting the car and removing the wheels.

### Day 1

**Task:** Perform a manual brake bleed on the car.

**Outcome and Discussion:** Car still has spongy brakes no change. Since there was no change in the brakes I decide that maybe there's a ceased glide pin or ceased brake shoe that's not sliding how it should be sliding, however I still think it might be air in the brake lines. so I decide that i'll replace the rotors, pads, and glide pin. All of these parts have wear and if I do need to take the vehicle to Les Scwab later I wont get pestered to have them replace these parts. I also find out that there's a special brake bleed of the ABS system that can only be performed with a scan tool that has the functionality. I order a scanner to do an ABS brake bleed.

### Day 2

**Task:** Perform brake service, replace rotors, pads, and glide pins on all 4 wheels, rebuild caliper brackets, and clean/inspect calipers and hubs. Not able to bleed the ABS system. Scanner does not support my vehicle.

**outcome and Discussion:** Car still has spongy brakes. I decide that it's time to take the car to Les Schwab to get their take on what's wrong, I aslo feel like they can do the ABS brake bleed since they'll most likely have the scan tool that works on my vehical.

When I get to Les Schwab I explain to the tech all the work I did to the brakes and the issue that I'm having, I also tell him that I did a manual bleed and that I can't do the scan tool bleed of the ABS system because I don't have the tool. He told me before looking at the car that the vehicle only needs a manual bleed and that my vehicle doesn't have the auto bleed function (Obviously wrong). After looking at the car. the tech told me that I most likely had a contaminant in the brake system that had deteriorated all the rubber gaskets, bladders, and parts in the system so I would need to replace the Master Cylinder, the brakelines, the ABS Module and all 4 calipers. Goodness me!? just the abs module alone would be $800-1000 he told me.

I asked him if there was anything I should try before going through all that work, he said there was nothing else I could try.

This tech is by far a really really bad person for Les Schwab to have working for them. He was wrong and also ready to make bad repair decision on other peoples cars relying on his faulty knowledge base without consulting vechicle documentation. It's like a fire store of bad mechanic.

### Day 3

**Task:** I get a scanner that supports my vehicle and perform an ABS module bleed on the car.

**Outcome and Discussion:** Vehicle is fixed, Brakes are like new. No more sponginess in the pedal.

Les Schwab is suppose to be a great place for people who need to rely on an expert to give them 'real' information to fix their vehicle. That is why there's a premium on their services, however it seems that their price doesn't represent a expert level of knowledge or experience anymore, and I wonder if it ever did.

The worst part is the amount that was at stake for this techs wrong information.
