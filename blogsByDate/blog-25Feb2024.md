## Title: Les Schwab... Fail!

My les schwab fail story.

My brakes started getting spongy, by that I mean that the brakes would stay engaged slightly when taking my foot off the pedal. This is obviously air o the line, so it's necessary to bleed the brakes.

So I read the documentation on my car on how to bleed the brakes and in order to do it I needed to get the whole car lifted and placed on jack stands. There's ways to bleed the brakes with out taking the wheels off but it's just easier for me to see what I'm doing with the wheels off, so each time I go to work on my car I'm going to be going through the extra work of lifting the car and removing the wheels.

Day 1

Task: Perform a manual brake bleed on the car.

Outcome and Discussion: Car still has spongy brakes no change. Since there was no change in the brakes I decide that maybe there's a ceased glide pin or ceased brake shoe that's not sliding how it should be sliding, however I still think it might be air in the brake lines. so I decide that i'll replace the rotors, pads, and glide pin. All of these parts have wear and if I do need to take the vehicle to Les Scwab later I wont get pestered to have them replace these parts. I also find out that there's a special brake bleed of the ABS system that can only be performed with a scan tool that has the functionality. I order a scanner to do an ABS brake bleed.

Day 2: Perform brake service, replace rotors, pads, and glide pins on all 4 wheels, rebuild caliper brackets, and clean/inspect calipers and hubs. Not able to bleed the ABS system. Scanner does not support my vehicle.

outcome and Discussion: Car still has
